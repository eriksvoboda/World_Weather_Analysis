# World Weather Analysis

For this project we used different APIs from Open Weather and Google to get city location and weather information. Using the data from these APIs we are able to use gmap to create maps with locations within the desired maximum temperature range. We're also able to create a route between a starting city and multiple stop locations and back to the start city.
